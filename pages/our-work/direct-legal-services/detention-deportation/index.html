    <div class="content">
      <p>
        We believe that people should not be incarcerated in immigration
        detention centers, and that all people are entitled to competent and
        meaningful legal representation. We take on a variety of cases,
        representing people who are recent arrivals to the United States as well
        as those who have been in the country for many years. Our clients
        include survivors of domestic violence, trafficking, and torture, as
        well as people who have been convicted of crimes. We also take cases
        that are challenging in order to make sure we are making a meaningful
        impact for our clients and their families.

      <h2 class="subtitle">What is Immigration Detention?</h2>
      <p>
        Immigration detention is the government’s practice of incarcerating
        people as they go through deportation proceedings to determine whether
        they will be deported or allowed to remain in the United States. The
        United States has the largest immigrant detention infrastructure in the
        world. In 2018, the US government detained about 400,000 people in over
        200 immigration prisons. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is
        the federal agency that runs the immigration detention system. However,
        62% of immigration detention facilities are subcontracted to private
        prison companies. The Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma is the third
        largest immigration detention center in the country, and it is run by
        the GEO Corporation. It has the capacity to detain up to 1,575 people.
        The maximum capacity represents only the number of individuals who can
        be detained at any one time; the number of individuals actually
        processed through the facility during a one year period has exceeded
        10,000 in prior years.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Who is Impacted by Immigration Detention?</h2>
      <p>
        People in detention include those who have been in the United States for
        years as well as very recent arrivals. Also included are pregnant women;
        people with mental and physical illnesses; survivors of domestic
        violence, torture, and human trafficking; and other particularly
        vulnerable people. In recent years, we have also seen an increase in the
        detention of unaccompanied minors after they turn 18 and are considered
        adults.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">
        Four Ways NWIRP Helps People in Immigration Detention
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal Orientation Presentations</strong>: To reach as many
        people as possible, NWIRP provides legal orientation presentations in
        which we give legal presentations and individual orientations to over
        3,000 people each year.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Direct Representation</strong>: : NWIRP directly represents
        approximately 150 immigrants detained at the NWDC every year.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Referrals to Volunteer Attorneys</strong>: NWIRP refers
        approximately 40 cases of immigrants who are detained at the NWIRP to
        private attorneys who volunteer their time to provide free legal
        representation on behalf of our organization every year.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Brief Services and Legal Advice</strong>: NWIRP provides more
        limited assistnace in cases where we are unable to fully represent a
        client or place their case with a volunteer attorney.

      <h2 class="subtitle">Frenselia's Story</h2>
      <img
        src="../../../../uploads/2015/06/Meghan-and-Franselia.jpg"
        alt=""
        class="s"
      />
      <p>
        Franselia grew up in a small town in El Salvador. Shortly after
        graduating from high school, her boyfriend was murdered by a well-known
        gang. After bravely reporting the murder to the police, Franselia began
        to be threatened by the gang. She made the long journey to the United
        States to seek safety. At the border, she was immediately detained and
        sent to the Northwest Detention Center. Shortly afterwards, she met
        Meghan, one of our attorneys, who took her case. After seven months in
        detention, Franselia won her asylum case. She has now been reunited with
        her family in the United States and is safe from harm.
