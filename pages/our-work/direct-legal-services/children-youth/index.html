    <h1 class="title mt">Children & Youth</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Some immigrant children face poverty, lack of parental support,
        illiteracy, lack of proper nutrition, lack of access to education in
        their home country, prior trauma, abuse and neglect. Immigrant children
        who face these issues are especially vulnerable because they have
        difficulty advocating for themselves.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Immigrant Rights Include</h2>
      <p>
        Children and Youth have the right not to suffer abandonment, abuse,
        neglect or similar mistreatment by a parent. Congress created Special
        Immigration Juvenile status in 1990 to grant immigration relief to
        children and youth who have been abandoned, abused or neglected by
        parents. SIJS procedures and eligibilities were amended in 2008. A child
        or youth is eligible to apply for SIJS if a state juvenile court
        determines that they cannot be reunified with one or both of their
        parents due to abuse, abandonment, neglect, or a similar basis under
        state law, and also declares that it is not in the child’s best
        interests to be returned to their home country. Children and youth who
        are granted Special Immigrant Juvenile Status are eligible to apply for
        a green card in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children and youth and their parents also have the right not to suffer
        persecution in their home country due to race, religion, nationality,
        political opinion or membership in a particular social group.
      </p>
      <h4>NWIRP Protects Rights</h4>
      <p>
        NWIRP guarantees access to life-altering forms of immigration relief to
        children and youth who have been abandoned, abused or neglected by their
        parents:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          NWIRP files affirmative applications (self-petitions) before United
          States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) for children and
          youth who have been abandoned, abused or neglected by one or both
          parents.
        </li>
        <li>
          If children and youth who have been abandoned, abused or neglected by
          one or both parents are in removal (deportation) proceedings, NWIRP
          fights the deportation through applications for relief for Special
          Immigrant Juvenile Status.
        </li>
        <li>
          If children and youth, or children and youth and their parents are in
          removal proceedings and fear harm or persecution in their home country
          based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or
          membership in a particular social group, NWIRP fights the deportation
          through application for relief for asylum.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Sergio's Story</h2>
      <img src="../../../../uploads/2015/06/featured-back-1.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        When Sergio was just three years old, his mother died. His father
        abandoned the family and Sergio was left to live with an aunt. He
        attended school until he was 14 and that is when the problems began.
        While leaving school one day, a group of gang members asked him to join
        their gang. When Sergio refused, they beat him up. He dropped out of
        school and moved around to live with friends of his aunt, but the
        threats continued. The gang members found him and beat him badly again.
        Sergio was too afraid to go to the hospital for his injuries because
        hospital staff might notify the police and the gang would then retaliate
        further. He did not leave his aunt’s home for fear of further attacks.
        Finally, when Sergio was 17, he fled Guatemala.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon entering the US, Sergio was caught by immigration officials. He was
        placed in “deportation and removal proceedings”. Because Sergio was a
        minor and because he was abandoned and abused, Sergio qualified for
        Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. NWIRP’s attorney represented him
        before the judge and helped him secure lawful permanent residence. Now
        Sergio lives with a foster family and is able to safely pursue his life.
