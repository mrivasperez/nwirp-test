    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="subtitle"></h2>
      <p>
        On December 4, 2020, a federal judge in New York ordered the Trump
        Administration to restore the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood
        Arrivals) program to the way it existed prior to September 2017, when
        the Administration moved to try to terminate the program.

        <h3>
          DACA allows me to pursue my education without the fear of being
          deported.
        </h3>
      </blockquote>
      <img src="../../../../uploads/2015/06/Guadalupe.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        I was born in Mexico, but have been in the United States since I was
        only 6 months old. Even though I have been in the US nearly my whole
        life, I am undocumented.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a child I dreamed of becoming a surgeon, but because of my status I
        thought'd it'd be impossible for me to go to college, let alone afford
        the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found out about Northwest Immigrant Rights Project around the time
        that the DACA program was announced. NWIRP gave me the opportunity to
        have my DACA application reviewed by someone who knows the law and could
        give me the assurance that everything was done right.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am so excited that this new program allows me to go to college without
        the fear of being deported.
