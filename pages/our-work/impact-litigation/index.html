      <p>
        When laws and policies are unjust, we work for systemic change. During
        the last decade, we have positively affected many important cases with
        implications for national immigration laws. Our impact litigation work
        has helped fight racial profiling by border patrol officials in the
        Olympic Peninsula, secured the right to an attorney for mentally ill
        immigrants facing deportation, and ensured that immigrants are
        considered for conditional parole from detention when they qualify.
      </p>
      <p>
        To respond to the growth of immigration appeals at the Federal and Ninth
        District Courts, we increased our focus in this area by establishing a
        new legal unit in 2005. At any one time, the Impact Litigation Unit has
        several cases pending before the federal courts. NWIRP was invited by
        the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to speak at a roundtable discussion
        on how to deal with the Circuit's large volume of immigration cases.

                <p>
                  Challenge to USCIS's policy and practice of rejecting certain
                  immigration applications on the basis of nothing more than spaces left
                  blank on the application forms. This new policy reflected a monumental
                  shift in adjudication standards, enacted by USCIS without notice to
                  the public. As a result, USCIS rejected thousands of applications,
                  resulting in lost deadlines for some of the most vulnerable
                  immigrants, including asylum applicants and survivors of serious
                  crimes.

                  December 23, 2020, while the parties engage in settlement

                  Class action under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) challenging
                  the systematic delay by USCIS and ICE to respond to requests for
                  immigration files (often referred to as A-Files). Those files are
                  needed by immigrants to defend themselves in removal proceedings and
                  to move forward with their applications for immigration benefits. The
                  FOIA statute requires the government to respond within 20 days and yet
                  immigrants are systematically forced to wait for several months before
                  the government responds.

                  responses to FOIA requests for A-files. On September 30, plaintiffs
                  filed a motion for summary judgment. A hearing on the motion was held

                  Challenges delays in adjudication of employment authorization
                  documents (EADs) for certain asylum applicants. On July 18, 2017, the
                  court certified a nationwide class of asylum applicants whose pending
                  applications for their initial EADs were not adjudicated within the
                  required 30-day regulatory timeframe and who did not receive interim
                  employment authorization. The court granted the government’s motion to
                  dismiss the claims of the named plaintiffs whose EAD applications were
                  subject to the 90-day regulatory timeframe, concluding that DHS’s
                  amended EAD regulations, which went into effect on January 17, 2017,
                  rendered those claims moot. The case has moved forward with the 30-day
                  nationwide class.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following summary judgment briefing by both parties, the court ruled
                  in Plaintiffs’ favor on July 26, 2018. The court ordered USCIS to
                  follow the law and timely adjudicate initial EAD asylum applications.
                  On September 21, 2018, the government appealed the district court’s
                  July 26, 2018 order granting summary judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor.
                  Briefing was completed in early August 2019.

                  Class action on behalf of petitioners for Special Immigrant Juvenile
                  Status (SIJS) challenging USCIS's new and unlawful policy of denying
                  SIJS for youth who obtained the necessary state court orders after they
                  turned 18. The new policy violates the controlling statute by refusing

                  but before they turned 21. The Immigration and Nationality Act makes
                  clear that any unmarried youth under 21 years of age is eligible to
                  apply for SIJS if a state court makes findings that the youth is unable
                  to be reunited with one or both parents because they have been
                  abandoned, abused, or neglected, and that it is not in the youth's best
                  interest to return to their country of origin.

                <p>
                  After oral arguments on July 16, 2019, Judge Robert S. Lasnik granted
                  Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Motion for Preliminary
                  Injunction. The government was enjoined from denying SIJS on the grounds
                  that a Washington state court does not have authority to "reunify" a
                  child with their parent, and was also enjoined from initiating removal
                  proceedings against or removing any SIJS petitioner whose petition was
                  denied on those grounds. USCIS moved for reconsideration, and on August
                  23, Judge Lasnik denied the government's motion." I'm attaching the
                  orders granting class certification and preliminary injunction.

                  In March of 2019, the court granted nationwide class certification for
                  both the credible fear interview class and the bond hearing class, and
                  in April, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for preliminary
                  injunction. On April 16, 2019, the Attorney General issued a Board of
                  Immigration Appeals decision in Matter of M-S- which sought to
                  eliminate bond hearings altogether for class members. Plaintiffs filed
                  a third amended complaint and a motion to modify the existing
                  preliminary injunction, and defendants moved to vacate the preliminary
                  injunction. On July 2, Judge Pechman upheld the modification of the
                  preliminary injunction and denied defendants' motion. Defendants
                  appealed the court's order, and parties are currently engaged in
                  briefing at the Ninth Circuit. Bond hearings without procedural
                  protections were restored to class members.

                  Class action on behalf of recipients of Temporary Protected Status
                  (TPS) who reside in Circuit Court jurisdictions where USCIS routinely
                  fails to acknowledge TPS as satisfying the requirement for inspection
                  and admission in order to adjust their status and receive lawful
                  permanent residency. However, the Sixth and Ninth Circuits have held
                  that a TPS holder is considered in “lawful status as a nonimmigrant”
                  and therefore eligible to become a lawful permanent resident (LPR).
                  Class members assert that Defendants’ failure to grant applications
                  for LPR status to TPS holders is in violation of the TPS statute.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Individual § 1983 claim seeking damages and declaratory relief against
                  a Yellowstone County judge and deputy sheriff for unlawfully detaining
                  and arresting plaintiff while he was testifying on behalf of his wife
                  at Yellowstone County Justice Court. Mr. Reynaga asserts both that the
                  Defendant judge overstepped his authority in calling local law
                  enforcement from the Yellowstone County Courthouse, and also that
                  local law enforcement overstepped authority in arresting and detaining
                  Plaintiff without probable cause that he had committed any crime. Mr.
                  Reynaga's motion for summary judgment was granted on his § 1983
                  claims, and defendants have appealed the decision to the Ninth
                  Circuit. Parties are currently briefing the case at the Ninth.

                  Mendez Rojas, et al., v. Johnson, et al., 2:16-cv-1024 (W.D. Wash.)
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Mendez Rojas is a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of asylum
                  seekers challenging the federal government’s failure to give them
                  notice of the one-year deadline for filing asylum applications as well
                  as its failure to guarantee them a mechanism through which to abide by
                  that deadline. On March 29, 2018, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion
                  for summary judgment and ordered the government to provide notice to
                  class members of the one-year filing deadline and to adopt, publicize,
                  and implement uniform procedural mechanisms that will ensure that
                  class members are able to file their asylum applications in a timely
                  manner. The parties have now reached a settlement agreement for
                  implementing the court’s order.

                  for the Western District of Washington ruled that the U.S. Citizenship
                  and Immigration Services (USCIS) must adjudicate asylum applicants’
                  initial (first time) applications for employment authorization
                  documents (EADs) within 30 days. USCIS is currently required to follow
                  the Judge's decision, but has appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of
                  Appeals. Details regarding this case and how to obtain benefits under

            <p>
              Individual § 1983 claim seeking damages and declaratory relief against
              the City of Marysville for unlawfully holding Mr. Ahumada-Meza
              overnight after he was ordered to be released from the Marysville
              Detention Center. The city kept Mr. Ahumada-Meza in custody solely on
              the basis of an administrative immigration detainer, which does not
              afford the City legal authority to hold someone. On January 8th, Mr.
              Ahumada-Meza settled this lawsuit. According to the terms of the
              settlement, the City agreed to pay Mr. Ahumada $85,000 for violating
              his Fourth Amendment rights by unlawfully detaining him pursuant to a
              detainer issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In
              addition, the City has changed its policy to ensure that other
              immigrants are not unlawfully detained.

            <p>
              Individual § 1983 claim seeking damages, declaratory relief, and
              injunctive relief against Tukwila Police Department for actions taken
              against him and their policies and practices countenancing such
              actions: namely, seizing him—the victim of a crime who sought police
              assistance—in order to investigate his immigration status, and
              subsequently extending his seizure in order to communicate with
              federal immigration enforcement officers and effectuate his transfer
              to federal immigration custody. Mr. Rodriguez asserts that Defendants
              have no authority to detain or extend any detention for purposes of
              investigating immigration status or transferring custody of an
              individual to federal immigration authorities, and that such actions
              violate his Fourth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. On
              May 8, the court granted Plaintiff's motion for partial summary
              judgment, ruling that defendant officers violated the Fourth Amendment
              seizing Mr. Rodriguez. Plaintiff settled all remaining claims against
              defendants.
