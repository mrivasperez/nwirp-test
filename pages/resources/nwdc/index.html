        The Northwest Detention Center is an immigration prison located in
        Tacoma, Washington. Opened in 2004, the NWDC is a privately owned and
        operated by the GEO Group on behalf of U.S. immigration and Customs
        Enforcement. The NWDC's current capacity is 1575, making it one of the
        largest immigration prisons in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Northwest Immigrant Rights Project's Tacoma office is dedicated to
        serving detainees at the NWDC, with 10 full-time staff currently focused
        on providing direct legal representation. Our staff meets with detainees
        one-on-one to access their immigration cases and identify forms of
        relief; conducts workshops to help detainees fill out applications for
        relief and prepare for court; identifies wrongfully detained US citizens
        and facilitates their release from detention; advocates for the most
        vulnerable of the detained population, including the mentally ill,
        elderly, and handicapped; and provides "Know Your Rights" presentations
        to detainees to explain the legal process and potential forms of relief.
        If you know someone who is currently detained at the Northwest Detention
        Center, please contact us at tacoma@nwirp.org.<br />
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Basic Information</h2>
      <p>
        The NWDC is located in Tacoma, Washington, about 40 minutes south of
        Seattle. The address for the facility is
        <strong>1623 East J Street, Tacoma, WA, 98421</strong>. Parking is
        available on the street in front of the prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Address:</strong> The NWDC is about 1.2 miles from the Tacoma
        Dome Bus Station, located at 610 Puyallup Avenue, Tacoma, Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What is an "A" Number? </strong>An “A” number is a 9-digit
        number assigned to non-citizens in the United States by the Department
        of Homeland Security. If the person detained did not have an A number
        prior to detention, one will be issued when they are processed into the
        detention center. This number is printed on all paperwork issued by the
        government regarding immigration, and can also be found on bracelets
        worn by detainees.
      </p>
      <h4>Visitation</h4>
      <p>
        <b>How do I find out if someone is at the NWDC?</b> If you have the full
        name and A number of the person you are looking for, you can try to find

      <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        1. Immediate Family: mothers, fathers, stepparents, foster parents,
        brothers, sisters, children, spouses, including common-law spouses,
        grandparents, uncles, aunts, in-laws, godparents or any other person who
        has custodial responsibility for the detainee.

      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        4. Minors: at the Associate Warden’s discretion, a minor without
        positive identification may be admitted with a parent, guardian, or
        adult visitor. Minors are to remain under the direct supervision of an
        adult visitor, so as not to disturb other visitors. Disruptive conduct
        by minors, accompanying adults or detainees may cause termination of the
        visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not visit if you are undocumented or have doubts about your current
        immigration status. If you lie about your status, this could have future
        consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What do visitors have to bring? </strong>All adults must have
        photo identification. A driver’s license or other state I.D. is best.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How many visitors can a detainee have? </strong>A maximum of two
        adults and two children may visit a detainee at any one time. This
        regulation is to be interpreted flexibly and subject to exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Visiting hours: </strong>Visitation hours are from 8:00am<strong>
          to </strong
        >11:00am<strong> and </strong>1:00pm<strong> to </strong>3:30pm<strong>

        >, including holidays. The prison is closed to visitors on Tuesdays and
        Wednesdays.
      </p>
      <h4>Phone Calls and Mail Rules and Regulations</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Can detainees make phone calls? </strong>Detainees can make
        calls from the NWDC using a personal PIN number issued to them if they
        have money in their accounts. The rate for calls is 10 cents for local
        calls and 15 cents for long-distance calls. Detainees can also make
        collect calls. If you are having trouble receiving collect calls from
        the detainee, you should call 1-866-348-6231. Certain calls, such as
        those to free legal services and consulates, are free. There are
        instructions for how to make free calls above the phones in each unit.
        NOTE: ICE and the NWDC reserve the right to record any phone calls made
        from or to the facility, except for attorney calls where the attorney
        has specifically requested the number be exempted from monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can I call a detainee?</strong> You can not call a detainee
        directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can I leave a phone message for a detainee? </strong>In case of
        family or other emergencies, or to leave messages for a detainee, you
        can call 253-396-1611. Messages must be short and usually serve only to
        prompt the detainee to call you back. Messages are delivered daily,
        between 3:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. You can also leave voicemail messages of
        up to three minutes in length for detainees by calling (888) 516-0115
        for a $2.95 fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can detainees send mail? </strong>Detainees can send mail at any
        time at their own expense. Detainees who are indigent can send up to
        three pieces of regular-size mail at the facility’s expense per week.
        Detainees can send up to three pieces of regular-size mail at the
        facility’s expense per week.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can I send mail to a detainee? </strong> <br />
        Detainees can receive mail, as long as it does not include any
        prohibited items that are considered contraband, such as paperclips or
        rubber bands. Also keep in mind that detainees cannot usually receive
        original identity documents, and it is preferable to send copies of such
        documents if they are for the detainee’s legal case.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Use the following address: </strong></p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        [Detainee Name] <br />
        [Alien "A" Number] <br />

      <h2 class="subtitle">
        <strong>Money and Property Rules and Regulations </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>How do I put money in a detainee’s account? </strong>To put
        money in a detainee’s account, you can drop off cash or a U.S. Postal
        Money Order with the reception officer between 7:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
        You can also send U.S. Postal Money Orders. Sending cash is strongly
        discouraged. Money orders other than those issued by the U.S. Post
        Office will not be placed in the detainee’s account. You can also
        <a href="http://www.inmatedeposits.com" target="_blank"
          >make deposits online</a
        >, by telephone at 1-866-345-1884, or by using one of the machines in
        the lobby of the NWDC. Both you and the detainee should receive a
        receipt for any funds accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >How do I give money or property to someone who is getting deported? </strong
        >Detainees will receive in cash any money left in their account. You can
        put money in the detainee’s account using the instructions above. The
        money should be available within 30 minutes. Detainees must follow these
        procedures to receive property to take with them when they are deported:
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        Step 1: The detainee fills out a KITE available in their unit to receive
        the property. The request must list what property the detainee is
        receiving and who will be bringing the property.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        Step 2: The form will be sent for approval by ICE.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        Step 3: Once the request is approved, the detainee will be notified and
        a letter will be sent to front desk specifying who is bringing the
        property and what the property it is. The detainee will also be told
        when their friend/family should bring the property.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        Step 4: The person dropping off the property comes to the front desk of
        the detention center from 4:30 - 6:00 PM.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >What kind of property can a detainee typically receive for
          deportation? </strong
        >One suitcase, no more than 40 pounds, filled with clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Can detainees get their IDs back after they are released from the
          detention center? </strong
        >If the detainee is being deported, ICE will not return state or
        US-issued IDs. ICE will return foreign national IDs. If the detainee is
        released on bond, state ID documents will be returned.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Bonds and Bond Hearings</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What is a bond? </strong>A bond is money paid to the government
        in return for the detainee’s release. It is a guarantee that the
        detainee will go to all court hearings and comply with the judge’s final
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Who sets a bond? </strong>ICE can set a bond. Detainees usually
        receive a piece of paper with the heading: “Notice of Custody
        Determination” on it that has the amount of bond that ICE set.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Immigration Judge can also set a bond. If ICE did not set a bond
        amount, the detainee can ask the Judge to set one by asking for a Bond
        Hearing. The detainee can also ask the Immigration Judge to lower the
        bond that ICE set by requesting a bond hearing. However, the Immigration
        Judge does not have the power to lower everyone’s bond amount. Also, the
        Immigration Judge has the power to raise the amount or take the existing
        bond away.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can the Immigration Judge set a bond for everyone? </strong>No.
        The Immigration Judge cannot set a bond for certain people. For example,
        people who are being charged as an “arriving alien” (someone who is
        picked up at a port of entry, like a land border or the airport), or
        people who were convicted of certain types of crimes, cannot get a bond
        from the Judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How does the detainee request a bond hearing? </strong>The
        detainee can either ask the Immigration Judge for one in person at the
        first master calendar hearing, or the detainee can fill out a Motion
        Requesting Hearing for Bond Determination and mail to the court: Tacoma
        Immigration Court, 1623 East J Street, Suite 3, Tacoma, WA 98421. NWIRP
        can assist pro se detainees with this process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >What is the best way for a detainee to prepare for a bond hearing? </strong
        >The Immigration Judge is looking for two things: 1) Whether the
        detainee is a danger to the community; and 2) Whether the detainee is a
        “flight risk” – meaning, whether the detainee is likely to go to all
        future court hearings. Detainees are encouraged to invite family members
        and friends to bond hearings and provide supporting documents to the
        Immigration Judge, such as letters from friends, family and employers.
      </p>
      <p>The entire bond must be paid for the detainee to be released.</p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Immigration Court</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>How do I check a detainee's immigration case status? </strong
        >The easiest way to check the status of a case in immigration court is
        to call their automated number: 1-800-898-7180. You will need the
        detainee’s full 9-digit A number. If the A number only has 8 digits,
        enter a “0” at the beginning of the number.

        If the problem persists, it may be that the individual’s case is not
        scheduled to go before a judge, such as when the individual has been
        previously removed from the country, or when he or she has signed a
        stipulated order of removal. If you need more information, you can call

        <strong>What are the stages of immigration court proceedings? </strong
        >The first type of hearing a detainee will attend is called a Master
        Calendar Hearing. This hearing is similar to an arraignment in criminal
        court. At the hearing, many detainees will be brought to the courtroom
        at once, and the judge will spend a short time talking to each one. The
        judge will explain the government’s charges and inform the detainee of
        his or her rights. The judge will ask whether the detainee agrees with
        the government’s charges, listed in a document called a “Notice to
        Appear” (NTA). At this hearing, the detainee can also ask for a Bond
        Hearing, to get a bond or to get bond lowered. The detainee can also ask
        for more time to find a lawyer by requesting a Continuance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the detainee is eligible for a form of “relief” (a defense against
        deportation or removal) and wishes to apply for this relief, the judge
        will schedule an Individual Hearing. This also sometimes called a
        “merits hearing,” since this is when the detainee must present arguments
        for why he or she qualifies and should be allowed to stay in the U.S.
        The government attorney will also make arguments for why the detainee
        should be deported. Each side can present evidence and call witnesses.
        The judge will make a decision based on the arguments made at this
        hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the detainee disagrees with the judge’s decision at the Individual
        Hearing, he or she has the right to appeal to Board of Immigration
        Appeals (BIA). To appeal, the BIA must receive a “Notice of Appeal” from
        the detainee within 30 days of the decision issued at the Individual
        Hearing. The detainee can make arguments in the Notice of Appeal, or can
        indicate that he or she will be sending arguments in a written
        statement, called a “brief.” If the detainee submits a brief, he or she
        must do so by the time set by the BIA, or the BIA will reject the
        appeal. All arguments and decisions are made in writing, and are sent by
        mail.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the detainee disagrees with the BIA decision, he or she has the right
        to appeal to Federal Circuit Court. The Circuit Court for California,
        Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, among others, is the 9th Circuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another method of relief, mainly for those who have been ordered
        deported but who ICE is unable to deport, can challenge their detention
        through a Writ of Habeas Corpus. Individuals interested in pursuing this
        option should contact their local Federal Public Defenders for more
        information.
