    <div class="content">
      <p>We help immigrants obtain United States Citizenship.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Immigrant Rights Include</h2>
      <p>
        The right to become a U.S. citizen after satisfying the requirements as
        a lawful permanent resident. In general, an immigrant can apply to
        become a U.S. citizen five years after they become a lawful permanent
        resident (or 3 years if they are married to a U.S. citizen). However,
        they must demonstrate that they have good moral character (no
        disqualifying criminal record), and that they can pass a test
        demonstrating an ability to read, write and speak in English, and a
        knowledge of the U.S. government (unless they qualify for a disability
        waiver). By becoming citizens persons can now fully participate in civic
        life, with the right to vote in federal, state and local elections. In
        addition, they have greater rights in filing petitions to reunite with
        family members. Finally, they are also secure from being deported.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">NWIRP Protects Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          NWIRP ensures that people with disabilities can attain U.S.
          citizenship through advocacy with N-648 disability waivers and other
          issues
        </li>
        <li>NWIRP fights wrongful citizenship denials.</li>
        <li>
          NWIRP represents people with criminal records who are still eligible
          for U. S. citizenship through naturalization, including those with
          long histories of life and work in the U.S. and who have family
          members here.
        </li>
        <li>
          NWIRP defends U. S. citizens who have attained citizenship through
          birth, naturalization, or acquisition<br />
          through parents, but who have been wrongfully placed in removal
          proceedings.

      <h2 class="subtitle">Ivy's Story</h2>
      <blockquote style="padding: 0 50px; margin: 15px 0">
        <h3>
          America has always been my home. Because of NWIRP, I now have the
          paperwork to prove it.
        </h3>
      </blockquote>
      <img src="../../../../uploads/2015/06/Ivy-Little.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        When I got married my husband started drinking heavily. Our fights got
        unbearable, and I filed for divorce. My mother-in-law knew I wasn’t a
        citizen and used my status against me during our divorce proceedings.
        She told me she was going to have me deported.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experience left me feeling vulnerable. I wanted to become a citizen,
        but I was worried I would fail the test because I have some very serious
        learning disabilities. But then I found out about NWIRP.
      </p>
      <p>
        My case was taken on my Emily Headings, who was incredible. Anytime I
        had to go to the immigration office she came with me and made sure I was
        comfortable. She was amazing, I don’t know what I would have done
        without her.
      </p>
      <p>
        I passed my test and received my citizenship, 65 years after coming to
        America!
      </p>
      <p>
        All I can say is thank goodness for NWIRP. I am so glad they were there
        for me. After living my entire life in fear, I feel like a weight has
        been lifted off my shoulders. America has always been my home. Because
        of NWIRP, I now have the paperwork to prove it.
      </p>
