      <p>
        Northwest Immigrant Rights Project began in response to an emergency.
        Hundreds of thousands of Central Americans were fleeing the political
        repression and violence of civil wars to seek safety and asylum in the
        United States.
      </p>
      <p>But once they arrived, they found they were not welcome.</p>
      <p>
        The government did not want to offer the refugees asylum. They did not
        want to offer them safety. Instead, these refugees faced immigration
        authorities bent on sending them right back to war and persecution. Not
        only did they have no legal right to representation, most didn’t have
        money to hire a lawyer. They were forced to confront the threat and
        reality of deportation alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The refugees needed safe-haven. Many churches around the country began
        giving shelter to Central American refugees – in open defiance of
        federal law. They called this response the Sanctuary Movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Seattle, several local churches joined the Sanctuary Movement.
        Hundreds of Central Americans found refuge within the walls of churches
        around Seattle and the State. But they were not protected. Without legal
        representation, many of them would be deported back to the chaos and
        violence of Central America.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small group gathered together united in their determination to fight
        for justice and legal protection for the Central Americans seeking
        safety in the United States. Together, they mobilized volunteer
        attorneys to defend the rights of these refugees in their search for
        asylum.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the passage of the Immigration Control and Reform Act, there were
        immigrants and refugees from all over the world who desperately needed
        legal representation and advocacy if they were to receive the benefits
        of this new law. This new legislation, coupled with this new group's
        desire to help people from all countries, officially started the
        Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.
