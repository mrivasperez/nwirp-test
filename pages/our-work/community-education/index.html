        <img src="../../../uploads/2017/03/IMG_0042.jpg" alt="" srcset="" />
        <p>
          Our "Know Your Rights" Presentations are directed at community members
          who are interested in learning more about their legal rights. We cover
          a variety of topics including what to do if you or someone you know if
          approached by a police officer or immigration official, how the latest
          executive actions on immigration may affect you or members of your
          community, and a basic introduction to the United States' immigration
          system. These presentations are conducted by NWIRP legal staff members
          and are primarily offered in Spanish. You can find a list of all our
          upcoming Know Your Rights presentations by visiting the events page of
          our website.

        <img src="../../../uploads/2015/06/IMG_2702.jpg" alt="" srcset="" />

        <p>
          NWIRP provides training for service providers such as teachers,
          healthcare professionals, domestic violence advocates, social service
          providers, and others who may serve the immigrant community as part of
          their work. These sessions answer questions that community members may
          have about the immigration system, immigration enforcement, and how
          immigration issues affect the communities they serve. Our Immigration
          101 Training includes an overview of the immigration system and
          immigration status as well as which resources are available in the
          community.

          Legal Orientation Presentations: Northwest Detention Center, Tacoma,
          WA

          src="../../../uploads/2015/06/790-sign-and-wire-color-web.png"

          Individuals in immigration court have no right to an attorney if they
          cannot afford to pay for one. At the Northwest Detention Center in
          Tacoma, where 1,300 individuals are detained while they await
          immigration court, many cannot afford a private attorney.
        </p>
        <p>
          NWIRP's Tacoma office has been able to provide limited legal
          assistance to tens of thousands of detainees at the Northwest
          Detention Center who cannot afford private legal representation. Since
          2005, NWIRP has received funding through the U.S. Department of
          Justice to operate the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) at the
          facility. Through the LOP portion of their work, NWIRP's Tacoma staff
          provide group orientations that inform detainees about their legal
          rights, their legal options, and about what they can expect when they
          appear in court. The LOP also allows NWIRP to provide individual
          orientations and workshops to pro se detainees to assist with their
          applications for relief from deportation.
