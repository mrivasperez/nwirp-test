      <p class="p1">
        We defend the rights of people who have a fear of persecution in their
        home country and help them gain safety through asylum. The asylum unit
        also assists <span class="s1"><i>pro </i></span><i>s</i>e applicants
        with navigating the asylum application process and works with outside
        agencies, communities, and organizations to promote the rights and
        dignity of and offer support services to persons fleeing persecution in
        their home countries.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Immigrant Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Immigrants have the right to seek a safe haven from persecution and
        torture. Under U.S. and international law, persons who fear return to
        their home countries due to persecution or torture may be eligible for
        asylum and related protections.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">NWIRP Protects Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 1984 as part of a grassroots effort to respond to the legal
        needs of Central American refugees fleeing civil wars, NWIRP has played
        a key role in providing legal assistance for people fleeing persecution.
        We now assist asylum seekers from all around the globe: from the Horn of
        Africa and the Middle East, to Central and South America, to Russia and
        former states of the Soviet Union, and to East and South Asia.
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
        NWIRP helps people file applications for asylum with US Citizenship and
        Immigration Services’ Asylum Office and Immigration Court. We represent
        asylum seekers at their asylum interviews and immigration court
        hearings.
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
        NWIRP recruits, trains, and provides assistance for volunteer attorneys
        who take on asylum cases. We connect asylum-seekers with these volunteer
        attorneys, increasing our capacity to assist those who are seeking
        asylum.
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
        NWIRP defends asylum-seekers, asylees, and refugees against deportation
        from the United States in Immigration and Federal Courts. Even minor
        criminal convictions can be grounds for deporting a person granted
        asylum or refugee status back to the country where he or she fears
        persecution or torture.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        I had to flee from my home in Kenya when my husband tried to kill me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It broke my heart to leave my home, and my family. Soon afterwards I met
        a woman who told me the United States would be a safe place for me.
      </p>
      <p>But my suffering continued.</p>
      <p>
        The woman who promised me safety in the United States was a human
        trafficker. She sold me to a family who forced me to work as a domestic
        servant. I wasn’t paid. I wasn’t allowed to leave.<br />
        I was trapped in their home for over an entire year. But when a neighbor
        found out how I was being exploited, she helped me escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I found Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. They took my case and I
        was granted asylum. My attorney, Maggie, was so kind to me. She made me
        feel happiness. She made me feel hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that hope is a tree that grows inside you, and you have to let
        it live.
      </p>
      <p>NWIRP helped keep that tree of hope alive in me.</p>
