      <p>
        NWIRP's legal services are critical to helping thousands of immigrants
        in Washington State navigate the complexities of the United States
        immigration system so they can apply for asylum or other forms of
        immigration protection. Without appropriate legal assistance, the men,
        women and children served by NWIRP may be less likely to obtain legal
        immigration status, and more likely to be returned to a country where
        they face ill treatment, torture, or even death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to NWIRP's services can also be a major factor in providing
        economic and personal security. Without legal support, our clients are
        often unable to access medical assistance, housing or other basic
        services, and many of them are afraid to call the police for protection
        from domestic violence or other crimes.

          <p>
            Franselia grew up in a small town in El Salvador. She suffered
            significant child abuse when she was young, but persevered
            throughout and graduated from high school. Shortly after graduating,
            her boyfriend was murdered by a well-known gang in El Salvador.
            After reporting the murder to the police, local gangs began to
            threaten her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Franselia came to the United States to seek safety. Once she arrived
            at the United States/Mexico border, she was apprehended by
            Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and was sent to the Northwest
            Detention Center to be detained while she awaited her deportation
            hearing, which would decide if she could stay safely in the US or be
            deported back to El Salvador.
          </p>
          <p>
            Megan, an attorney NWIRP’s Tacoma office, met Franselia during a
            Legal Orientation Presentation and was able to take Franselia's case
            for direct representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afer being detained for nearly seven months, Franselia was granted
            asylum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite a life filled with hardships, she is consistently
            optimistic. Franselia is excited to be reunited with family members
            now that she has been released from detention.

            Joseph is a Tutsi refugee who fled the Democratic Republic of the
            Congo for the United States in the late 1990s during the genocidal
            Hutu-Tutsi conflict. He was forced to leave his wife Naomi after
            participation in a peaceful protest left him arrested, imprisoned,
            beaten, hospitalized and threatened with death.
          </p>
          <p>
            After arriving in the US, Joseph was immediately put in deportation
            proceedings. NWIRP placed Joseph’s case with a pro bono team from
            Davis Wright Tremaine. More than 10 years after Joseph first applied
            for asylum, and following many legal battles Joseph and Naomi were
            finally reunited. Overjoyed at being together again, the two hope to
            start the family they have always wanted.

            In 1998, Sergey and his two sons fled Ukraine due to religious
            persecution and sought safety in the United States, where they were
            granted asylum.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few years later, even as Sergey’s sons were serving with U.S.
            forces in Iraq, Sergey was detained. He had traveled abroad and when
            he re-entered the U.S., immigration officers claimed that he did not
            have the proper paperwork, despite his asylee status. A judge
            ordered him deported to Ukraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the help of a Northwest Immigrant Rights Project attorney,
            Sergey appealed his case to the U.S. Court of Appeals, where he
            prevailed. His deportation order was dropped, and last year, Sergey
            became a United States citizen.

            Bulgarian Client Receives Amnesty after 11 Years
          </h2>
          <p>
            In his home country of Bulgaria, there was hardly a moment in Ivan's
            life when he wasn't being persecuted for his or his family's
            anti-communist political beliefs and activities. Even while in his
            mother's womb, Communist officials severely beat his pregnant
            mother. As an outspoken youth, he was interrogated and detained
            several times. As an adult, Ivan spent 15 years of his life being
            physically and psychologically tortured in various prisons. He lost
            hearing in one ear during an explosion that was meant to take his
            life. Ivan was finally forced to flee Bulgaria to protect his family
            and preserve his own life.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Ivan arrived alone in New York in 1993, he received assistance
            in completing an asylum application from a local church and was
            temporarily allowed to live there. With money from the church, he
            moved to Seattle to find work. In 1994, Ivan sought the assistance
            of NWIRP, which identified a pro bono attorney to represent him.
            While his joined the backlog of asylum applications, Ivan struggled
            to find work and was forced to live on the streets in an old van he
            bought with earnings from occasional day labor work. In the years
            that followed, Ivan lost contact with his pro bono attorney. NWIRP
            attempted to locate Ivan, but Ivan was homeless.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Ivan returned to NWIRP a few years later to check in on his
            case, NWIRP's Asylum Unit took the case, helping Ivan apply for food
            stamps and connecting him with important services in the community.
            After more than 11 years, NWIRP finally received an asylum interview
            notice for Ivan. On February 23, 2005, nearly twelve years after
            Ivan first came to the United States and applied for asylum, Ivan
            had been granted asylum protection in the United States.

            Client Qualifies for Relief under the Convention Against Torture
          </h2>
          <p>
            On any given day, thousands of men, women and children are detained
            by the Department of Homeland Security. They include asylum-seekers
            and survivors of horrific abuse. Most of them will face years in
            prison. Only ten percent of them will go before a judge with the
            help of an attorney.
          </p>
          <p>
            Masoud Hosseini was one of these men. He was behind bars for four
            years. He lost his business, his marriage and 35 pounds. Four of his
            teeth rotted. He was never charged with a crime.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than a year ago Masoud's case was referred to Northwest
            Immigrant Rights Project as a case of first impression related to
            the Convention Against Torture. On September 28, 2006, the U.S.
            Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the Board of
            Immigration Appeals decision and awarded relief under the Convention
            Against Torture. After four years, he was released from detention.

            Risk of Deportation Averted for Mother of four
          </h2>
          <p>
            Angela, a 36 year old mother of four, came to the United States in
            1990. Throughout her ten-year marriage to a U.S. citizen, she
            suffered both physical and mental abuse. When Angela became pregnant
            with their fourth child, her husband left her for another woman and
            refused to complete the immigrant visa petition he had filed for
            her. Angela feared separation from her children as well as
            deportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Angela approached NWIRP's office in Granger after she was placed in
            deportation removal proceedings. NWIRP's staff assisted Angela in
            documenting and filing an immigration petition for victims of
            domestic violence, which was granted eight months later. With the
            approved petition, directing attorney, Matt Adams, returned to
            immigration court with Angela and applied for an adjustment of
            immigration status so that Angela could become a lawful permanent
            resident. After a brief hearing on the merits, the immigration judge
            granted Angela legal status. Angela burst into tears of joy in the
            courtroom.

            Salvadorian Granted U Visa for Victims of Crime
          </h2>
          <p>
            Juan Carlos Martinez Mendez came to the U.S. from El Salvador at the
            age of 14. His mother, step-father, sister and two brothers had all
            obtained legal status. Although he applied for legal status at the
            age of 15, he was placed in deportation proceedings almost
            immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            On June 29, 2003, Juan Carlos was shot in the head in a parking lot
            outside a friend's apartment. He lost his right eye, and his nose
            was almost completely destroyed. He also suffered major damage to
            the bone in his cheek and eye socket. Despite his injuries, Juan
            Carlos spent two years behind bars, with little hope of recovery and
            fear of being torn away from his family and the only home he
            remembered.
          </p>
          <p>
            NWIRP attorneys worked with Juan Carlos throughout two years of
            detention and numerous setbacks during a time when he had little
            reason to be optimistic. He recently told us, "Mentally and
            emotionally NWIRP provided me a lot of strength to not give up."
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully, on January 4, 2007, Juan Carlos was released from
            detention and granted relief under the U visa for victims of crime.
            Right after his release, he received the procedures to receive an
            artificial eye and repair his nasal passages.

            Young Man from Malawi Becomes a Permanent Resident
          </h2>
          <p>
            At the age of nine, Otis left Malawi in southeastern Africa to live
            with his mother in Washington State. Shortly after he arrived, his
            mother was diagnosed with cancer and for the next six years of his
            young life, Otis assumed the role of her caretaker. When symptoms
            were too severe, Otis arranged for her to get to the hospital and
            stayed home alone for days at a time. Otis often went hungry,
            sometimes living on Kool-Aid and Top Ramen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otis' future looked bleak and uncertain as his mother's cancer
            progressed. Risking deportation as his 18th birthday approached when
            it's more difficult to obtain documentation, Otis was referred to
            NWIRP. A NWIRP staff attorney was able to expedite a Special
            Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) Visa application for Otis, and it
            was approved just two weeks before he turned 18.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now a Permanent Resident, Otis is flourishing. He obtained a
            driver's license, a job, and even bought himself a car – none of
            which he would have been able to do without permanent status. Otis
            will graduate from high school soon, and looks forward to a future
            filled with opportunities thanks to the help he received from NWIRP.
