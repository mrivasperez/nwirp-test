        Like the rest of the community, we are concerned about ongoing
        coronavirus pandemic. We understand that many community members might
        have questions about how their immigration status might impact their
        ability to access medical care. We've put together these short English
        and Spanish language videos to answer these questions.

        You don’t have a Social Security Number. You don’t have health care. You
        have to take time off work or you are laid off because of the
        coronavirus. You can’t get unemployment benefits. What benefits can you
        or your family get? Worried that if you or your family get benefits it
        will keep you from passing the Public Charge test if you apply for a
        green card? Here are the facts.

        - At Dollar For, our biggest effort is expressed in our Debt Forgiveness
        program, in which we enforce the hospital’s Charity Care policies. In
        order for hospitals to keep their nonprofit status, they have to have
        programs in place that aid families without incomes large enough to
        cover their medical expenses, called Charity Care. Dollar For has
        created a tool for families to easily find out if they are eligible for
        the Charity Care program.
