        main line at (206) 587-4009 to sign up for a Family Visa Workshop and
        intake. If you live in eastern Washington, please contact the Granger
        office at (509) 854-2100 or the Wenatchee office at (509) 570-0054, for
        individual intakes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Family Rights Include</h2>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Meheret and Kiflow's Story</h2>
      <blockquote style="padding: 0 50px; margin: 15px 0">
        <h3>
          I was pregnant and did not want to be a single mother raising my baby
          alone with my husband far away.
        </h3>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        When Meheret, a Seattle resident and U.S. Citizen, married Kiflow of
        Ethiopia, she never anticipated so many obstacles in beginning their new
        life together. After their marriage ceremony, Kidane traveled to Addis
        Ababa, Ethiopia, to obtain their official marriage certificate. At the
        U.S. Embassy, officers mistrusted her motives and accused Meheret of
        attempting fraud by being paid to marry Kiflow, subsequently throwing
        her out of the embassy office. Determined, Meheret flew back and forth
        until she was able to officially document their marriage, however, ran
        into another obstacle when she tried to bring her husband to the U.S.
        With no other recourse, she contacted NWIRP's Seattle Family Services
        Unit and was assigned a legal advocate to help her with the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I was pregnant and did not want to be a single mother raising my baby
        alone with my husband far away," Kidane said. After recovering from the
        birth, she traveled to Addis Ababa to once again bring official proof of
        the couples' relationship via their newborn daughter's birth
        certificate. But the U.S. Embassy still denied Kiflow's visa.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a year of delay, NWIRP staff member Miriam Cervantes tried one
        final effort to reunite the family, referring the case to the office of
        Congressman McDermott. A staff assistant took the case into her hands
        and after several letters to the Embassy in Addis Ababa, Kiflow was
        finally given an appointment. After more than 18 months, Kiflow was
        finally reunited with his wife and was able to see his daughter for the
        first time. When asked about their new life together, Kiflow said, "I am
        so happy, I couldn't be happier."
